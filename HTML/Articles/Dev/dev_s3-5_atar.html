        It’s a waste of time. Redoing what was done is a massive, gigantic
        stupendous waste of time. It’s that simple. So I’m not going to do that
        anymore.

        <h2>Does this mean that the reboot is over?</h2>
        <p>
          Heck no! It just means working smart not hard. I still have a tone of
          housekeeping. I’m just going to be recycling and upcycling rather than
          remaking and manufacturing.

          I’m still going to be using the new repo – but my process if going to
          be a bit more modest. I’ll be trolling through the scrap heap that is
          the old repo and colleting all the hidden gems. Then I’ll pop them in
          here and give them a bit of polish to make sure they fit into the new
          structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll do this on a file and function level. For example, I may copy the
          full HTML structure for the old dev-log, but I’ll only cope parts of
          CSS definition so that my stylesheet is more manageable.

        <h2>Then why no just fix the old one?</h2>
        <p>
          I find it easier to keep track of things this way. There is an ‘in’
          pile and a ‘out’ pile. I could’ve don this with two folders on the old
          repo – but I started now so I might as well continue.
