      Took me long enough. But after a couple weeks of painful deliberation,
      coupled with a hefty dose of ‘other projects’ (procrastination) I’ve done
      it. I’ve integrated the SWUP library with my site. I’d like to reflect on
      this experience.

        <h2>What I’ve gained</h2>
        <h3>Slick transitions</h3>
        <p>
          The User experience has been improved. Page transitions are smother as
          advertised. It’s no secret that with a heavy template/content overhead
          my old site produced some rather jarring forced reloads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, hurling a bunch of transitions at the problem is no quick
          fix. If they are too plain or too busy the transition can be just as
          disruptive as the most disgusting reload. I still need to play around
          to make sure the transitions are subtle yet exacting. This is a rabbit
          hole, but a fun one and I’ll get there soon enough. This will give my
          site a bit more fluidity and allow me to improve the user experience
          in interesting new ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm considering the use of that hello world text gradient as some sort
          of a motief...
        </p>
        <h3>Improved perforce</h3>
        <p>
          Swup loads scripts once. This forced me to think about where, when,
          and how I fetched HTML data. With my old system I would need to load
          all my articles every single time I navigated to a new page. This
          process is slow and expensive &dash; and would get even worse as I
          write more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripts (and HTML outside of the designated container) are not
          discarded between pages, I only need to fetch resources once. For
          example: I can load and create all my shadow templates while the
          screen is neatly hidden behind the ‘hello world’ introduction. When I
          navigate to a new page that used the template my custom elements are
          already defined, and the shadow roots are appended as the DOM loads.
          Less repetitive operations and no unstyled content rearing its ugly
          head before the template element is defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dev-log, index and game articles are saved after the first time they
          are fetched. No more load waits to reload old content. Note: this
          works for now but as the site grows, I want to look into something
          like the swup
          <a
            href="https://swup.js.org/plugins/preload-plugin"
            target="_blank"
            class="inline-link"
            >preload Pugin</a
          >
          or an alternative library that can help me control when each article
          is loaded and assist in managing cache storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nav-bar? I load that once an keep a reference to its important
          elements (which I needed to do anyway). No need for DOM traversal or
          insertion of additional HTML, just toggle a class or too every now and
          then.
        </p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p class="retoric">Yeah yea, great user experience. We get it.</p>
        <p>No. My experience.</p>
        <p>
          This is my first time working with an external dependency. It wasn’t
          nearly as easy as it should have been but that’s how learning goes.
          I’ve done it now. There’s not big unknow regarding integration,
          packages, and API’s. I’m far more open to including libraires now that
          I’ve broken ground and got a taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, learning from this experience I’ll do a better job next time.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>What Have I learnt?</h2>
        <h3>Nothing worth doing is easy</h3>
        <p>
          In all honesty one of the reason, I chose swup was its “simplicity” (I
          was also feeling a bit lazy). The docs are short and sweet. The API is
          clear and concise. It’s set up with one line of code and… took 3 days
          to implement&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>Yup, 3 whole days.</p>
        <p class="retoric">WHY?</p>
        <p>
          I had not clue what I was doing. I had assumptions about how swup
          worked; many of which were incorrect. The simplicity of SWUP came at
          the cost of control &dash; for all my talk about not wanting to use a
          framework because I would need to re-work things, I found myself doing
          an awful lot of reworking.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s not a bad thing. I SWUP forced my site to be better
          constructed, less convoluted and more SEO friendly. The library fears
          the dark (ignores the shadow DOM) and keeps scripts between pages.
          Lots of my scripts were doing weird things in weird ways, making junk
          and obfuscating content. A link that swup can’t be seen by a
          web-crawler either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps if my site had been structured differently this would have
          been painless? Perhaps another transition library would have put up
          with my nonsense? We shall never know.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve come to realise that nothing is ever as simple as it seems and
          that’s okay. You don’t grow without struggling and overcoming that
          struggle.
        </p>
        <h3>Test, test, test</h3>
        <p>And thank goodness I did!</p>
        <p>
          Swup did some stuff I didn’t expect. Granted most of it was clearly
          explained in the documentation. I read it all but I didn’t really
          understand the implications until my site broke. I feel a bit silly –
          but thank goodness I before it all became too broken to trace.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the traumatic experience of discovering that
          <a
            href="https://pages.github.com/"
            target="_blank"
            class="inline-link"
            >GitHub pages</a
          >
          is allergic to Root references at the eleventh hour, I was careful to
          test my deployed (site rather than one hosted by my machine).
        </p>
        <p>
          An damn &dash; things were crazy. Swup keeps the header between pages
          which makes relatively referenced resources go mad when the page
          directory is changed. npm and Github pages weren’t getting along (and
          it didn’t help that I was using modules incorrectly). My shiny new
          swup based navigation system made liberal use of
          <code class="inline">windom.location.pathname</code> to identify which
          page it was on an act accordingly. Great right?
        </p>
        <p>Wrong!</p>
        <p>
          Github pages changes the pathname from
          <code class="inline">index.html</code> to
          <code class="inline">" "</code> (this is an empty string). Not
          challenging to fix but not trivial to identify if you don’t know what
          you looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many more small issues like these (some didn’t even have
          anything to do with using swup) that I simply did not foresee and
          would not have picked up without testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Debugging can be frustrating and tedious but I’m so glad I did it
          yesterday so that is don’t panic tomorrow.
        </p>
        <h3>Don’t be afraid to try and fail</h3>
        <p>
          I spent more time thinking about implementing swup than I did
          implementing it. I was anxious about committing to an external
          dependency. I was worried that I would chose the wrong one. I’m still
          worried I chose the wrong one. Would
          <a href="https://barba.js.org/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"
            >Barba’s</a
          >
          namespaces have helped me with my deployment woes? Would the adaptable
          control of
          <a href="https://highway.js.org/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"
            >highway</a
          >
          required less changes to my system and be quicker to integrate ? Or is
          the grass always greener on the other side?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no right or wrong answers: only different trade-offs. I’m
          99.99% sure that if I moved to another transition library, I’d find a
          new array of challenges and teething issues. I bet there is a heap of
          (clearly documented) spanners just witing to be thrown into my works.
          Spanners that I will only find if I get my hands dirty and try. I
          would have made a far more informed design if my research process hand
          been driven by testing and doing rather than reading and thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a reason you test-drive a car before buying it. Specs,
          recommendations, and reviews can be informative. But how you feel
          behind the wheel is what really matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In future, if I’m met with a choice with not clear answer I’m going to
          go for a ‘test-drive’ instead of deliberating in circles.

        <h2>What I lost</h2>
        <h3>Control?</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to systems, I like to micromanage letting someone else’s
          code into my system was a bit scary at times. I like to know what’s
          ‘under the hood’ but this doesn’t mean I could make it all. I may miss
          full control of my system but would my hacky, homemade beginner’s
          equivalent of swup have been better.?
        </p>
        <p>Heck no!</p>
        <p>Would it even have been easier for me to use? Probably not.</p>
        <h3>Time?</h3>
        <p>
          Sure, I would’ve liked to put more effort into other parts of the site
          instead of fighting swup. But I leant of a lot from it all. Time spent
          deliberating on the other hand&hellip;
        </p>
        <h3>Nothing much?</h3>
        <p>
          Almost. The scroll plugin is not the greatest when it comes to the
          opening and closing section of my dev-log. It gets a bit lost from
          time to time. I’ll probably need to fix this.
        </p>
        <p>
          There also some problems when navigating from the bottom of one page
          to the top of the other. The scroll effect tends to mess with the
          animation. I'm sure I'll find a way to fix this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d be lying if there weren’t times when I regretted using swup and
          swore that all JS libraries were comprised of pure evil. But I just
          didn’t know how to use them properly yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, I’m pleased I implemented swup. It’s not
          perfect. I’d like to have done thing differently. But hindsight is
          2020 and that year is worth forgetting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If anything, I regret not going all in and implementing a meatier
          dependency like Angular or React. It’s a bit late now, but as I get
          used to this whole ‘library’ thing it’s defiantly something for the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's see which new depandancy I impliment
          <a load-href="/devlog.html#dev_4-00" class="inline-link">next</a
          >&hellip;
