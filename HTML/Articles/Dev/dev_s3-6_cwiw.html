          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the internet standard when it
          comes to formatting and rendering information. And yet, while it
          allows for hyperlinking and other features Like the ‘details summary’
          tags, HTML’s text is hardly hyper. At least not by my standards.

        <h2>Why is it not 'hyper' enough?</h2>
        <p>
          The definitions of hypertext and hypermedia are points of contention.
          They mean different things to different people. For the sake of this
          entry ‘hypertext’ is any non-linear or changeable piece of literature
          where traversal is altered based on user input.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, this definition is loose, and I haven’t even dared to open the
          can of worms that comes with asking for my site to be ‘interactive’.
          But this article isn’t about all that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially my gripe with the current HTML structure of my site is
          that the content is static. Sure, I’m doing a whole to of dynamic
          loading a JS nonsense behind the scenes. The navigation is driven by
          things call HYPERlinks. Yet, to the user, the content of each page is
          a fixed, unchanging body of text. It is no different to a newspaper or
          book.

        <h2>But most websites are like that.</h2>
        <p>So?</p>
        <p>Am <em>I</em> most websites?</p>
        <p class="retoric">
          Of course not. Most websites aren’t nearly as pretentious.
        </p>
        <p>No no no!</p>
        <p>
          I’m not saying that it’s a bad thing. I’m not saying that it’s not
          hypertext. I just feel I can do more. I want the site to offer the
          user more than just simple navigation. The goal of this site is to
          impress so I need all the fireworks I can muster.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>But why this?</h2>
        <p>
          Because it’s interesting. I have a malleable medium at my fingertips,
          and I want to use more than a sliver of its potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changeable text has the potential to construct fascinating narratives
          and logic flows that would not be possible with traditional linear
          text. Leveraging this to my advantage should allow me to take the
          constitution and organisation of informastion on this site to a new
          level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the custom elements I want to create will manipulate the text
          in a specific manner to create a particular effect.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Just us JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, yes. I’m going to use JavaScript. But I don’t want to have to set
          that JavaScript up every single time I want certain functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom HTML allows me to code once then include a new feature as if it
          were regular markup as many times as I want. This should streamline
          content creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, that’s a potential problem. In fact my fear of creating content
          that is confuting to screen reader users (and web-crawlers) is one of
          the reasons I haven’t made these widgets earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s all well and good to watch the content of random ‘div’ change
          when the site is rendered on your monitor. But how will this be
          experienced via a screen reader? How can I let the user know something
          has changed? How can I take them there? How do I do all that without
          writing paragraphs in Aria?
        </p>
        <p>I don’t.</p>
        <p>
          Good design is lazy design. A screen reader reads a page from top to
          bottom. If I need a user to interact with one container to change
          another the interaction container will come first. It’s that simple.
          If I code with this paradigm in mind (and remember that I can always
          alter visual layout with good old CSS) there should be not accessibly
          issues when it comes to screen readers and my widgets.

      <section>
        <h2>And what are these "widgets" anyway?</h2>
        <p>Without further ado, here they are:</p>
        <h3>Pop-out text</h3>
        <p>
          This one is analogous to the
          <code class="inline">&lt;details&gt;</code>/<code class="inline"
            >&lt;summary&gt;</code
          >
          element, but without the
          <a class="inline-link" load-href="/devlog.html#dev_1-03"
            >odd inline behaviour</a
          >. <code class="inline">&lt;details&gt;</code> /
          <code class="inline">&lt;summary&gt;</code>
          is designed to hide additional information below a high-level summary
          and display it when the user clicks on the summary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="inline">Pop-out</code> text is designed to expand on a
          though within a body of text. The text that pops out is an equal level
          to the original text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference between the two is subtle and I have been using the
          detail widget for this exact functionality until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main reason for changing is that details are by default block-level
          element and not intended to expand in-line text. Evan with the
          necessary CSS they don’t quite behave as I would expect in some
          contexts. Furthermore they seem to be impossible to animate.
        </p>
        <h3>Replace-text</h3>
        <p>
          The idea here is simple. Click on some text and it changes into
          different text. Unlike <code class="inline">Pop-out</code> which
          elaborates on ideas or gives additional information &dash; this widget
          alters the text that is already present.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Why would this be useful?</p>
        <p>
          Why wouldn’t it? It allows me to tease the user with changing bits of
          text. My main intention is to be able to go off on tangents. If the
          user wants to follow that target, they can get each new line by
          clinking on the <code class="inline">&lt;replace-text&gt;</code>. If I
          were to do this with pop-outs it would slowly engulf the entire
          document.
        </p>
        <h3>Branch-text</h3>
        <p>
          The HTML structure for this one is slightly different where the
          content block will be defined outside of the main widget and accessed
          by ID. This could let me have several branches leading to the same
          conclusion without too many nested elements or the need to replace
          code.

        <h2>An when do we get to see all of this in action?</h2>
        <p>
          When I get round to it. I’m required to implement and external API
          dependency so I’m going to be focusing on that for now.
