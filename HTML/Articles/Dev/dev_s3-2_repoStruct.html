        One of my main motivations for the new reboot was an opportunity to make
        a more organised repository. The specific file structure is less
        important that a commitment to making and adhering to logical file
        saving conventions which allow me to save things easily.

        <h2>But how will you decide these conventions?</h2>
        <p>
          Good question. The most important goal is efficiency and simplicity –
          I should never be confused as to where my files are.
        </p>
        <p>
          It makes sense to separate files according to their general functions.
          Something like this:
        </p>
        <article class="display-block">
          <pre>
|
+---CSS
|
+---HTML
|
+---JavaScript
            </pre
          >
        </article>
        <p>
          However, it’s not that easy. For one, I need to put my index.htm in
          the root directory if I want to publish the site to GitHub pages. If
          my index is in the root directory, I could put my other pages there to
          standardize how I link resources such as script and stylesheets.
          GitHub pages doesn’t allow for root referencing but being able to do
          relative referencing for the root may be the next best thing. Besides
          my current repo has unnecessarily long paths which just make
          organisation painfully long and increase the risk of me making an
          error when I defined asset locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of assets I think I should add a folder for those too. (You
          know for pictures, images and so on).
        </p>
        <article class="display-block">
          <pre>

| index.html
| blog.html
| games.html
| devlog.html
| about.html?

        <p>
          Yeah, no. This a very messy setup indeed. And what if I want to add
          more pages in the future? Do I really want a massive file dump right
          in my root?
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">
          It’s ganna be somewhere. The root isn’t sacred. Just make a call and
          move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess. But I have a way to navigate back to the root and honest and
          html folder is very much worth it cause I’m going to need to throw a
          lot in there:
        </p>
        <article class="display-block">
          <pre>
|   index.html

|   | about.html

        <p>
          The articles directory will hold all the content for my pages and the
          templates directory will hold all html custom templates like the
          nav-bar and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of me want to keep images near the articles that future them or
          save a stylesheet that is encapsulated in a template in the same
          directory as the template itself. I guess I will need to use a bit for
          deaccession and common sense here. Some styles and scripts will only
          ever need to be reference then and there. (I may even include them in
          the HTML if I hadn’t been explicitly told not to. I honestly think
          that there is a time and place to run script and do styling inside and
          html document. It’s not an arbitrary feature and it works for styles
          that do not need to be repeated and would either clutter up a style
          sheet or create more style sheets which clutter up the repo, but
          anyway)
        </p>
        <p>
          An alternative organisation system would be to give each page a folder
          which contains page specific CSS and JavaScript. But That seems like a
          recipe for over complication and too many directories. Separation of
          roles is a design matter of a reason and copying that in my directory
          organisation makes sense. I should stop overthinking this and move on
          to other matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          PS. I may include template specific CSS and JS in template
          subdirectories because in theory I should be able to move said
          templates to other projects. It may also make sense to do something
          similar with some dev-log demo code as I will only ever use it once
          for demonstration purposes.

        <h2>Naming conventions</h2>
        <p>
          Now that I have an idea of how things are stored, I think I should
          figure out what they will be called.
        </p>
        <h3>Page specific names</h3>
        <p>
          Basic html pages are easy. The blog should be
          <code>blog.html</code>blog.html. Any CSS that only plies to the blog
          should be in <code>blog.css</code>blog.css and any JavaScript that
          only works with the blog should be in <code>blog.js</code> (Obviously
          this trend should be extended to other sections.)
        </p>
        <h3>Article names</h3>
        <p>
          I plan to import articles (the content of each page) from separate
          html documents. This will allow me to do the html structure and
          formatting once then load any content as required. The idea of this is
          to reduce repetitive html structures. Articles could be names after
          their titles: for example, this may be repoStruture.html however this
          lack of context makes it hard for me to tell if this is a blog, game,
          or dev-log entry. It also makes it difficult to ensure that things are
          reference in chronological order. Hence, I’m going to be a little bit
          more pedantic:
        </p>
        <p><code>[section]_[Season]-[number]_[article name].html</code></p>
        <p>
          The sections the page I expect to display the content in: for example
          '<code>dev</code>[log]' or '<code>games</code>'. The season and number
          are a lose way of braking articles into chronological batches and the
          article name is, well the article name.
        </p>
        <p>For example, this is <code>devlog_s3-1_repoStruct</code>.</p>
        <p>
          Anyhow, that’s quite enough deliberation. I should get to work making
          it happen.
