      It’s been a while since I looked a what JS libraries could do and
      explained why I wanted one. Now it’s time to choose. I’ve spent a lot of
      time reaching and pontificating with libraries. Its hight time I figured
      out exactly what I want. Vanilla JS is nice and all, but it would be
      better with chocolate sprinkles.

        <h2>What do I need?</h2>
        <p>
          There is not shortage of JS libraires. With a plethora of options out
          here the shear variety and functionality are rather overwhelming.
          JavaScript libraires can control anything from DOM to data (while
          managing all the little gremlins in between)
          <a class="inline-link" href="#dev_3-08_ref"><cite>[1]</cite></a
          >. I’ve spent longer than I should have jumped down dozens of rabbit
          holes and the truth is I still have no clue which flavour of library
          to choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          But surely, I must have some idea of what to write next. If I could
          wish for one section of this site to be written for me, what would it
          be?

        <h2>World DOMination?</h2>
        <p>
          One of my first thoughts was a DOM manipulation library. The obvious
          answer to this is
          <a href="https://jquery.com/" class="inline-link" target="_blank"
            ><cite>jQuery</cite></a
          >.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes
          things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling,
          animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works
          across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and
          extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people
          write JavaScript.
        </blockquote>
        <cite>jquery.com</cite>
        <p>
          Before I started researching, using jQuery seemed like an open and
          such case. It does all I need and more. Awesome animations [2][3][4].
          Simple syntax [3][4][5]. Enhanced DOM manipulation [2][3] abilities
          and Cross-browser support [2][3]. From the outside jQuery seemed to be
          an industry standard whose use was taken as given. Surly there must be
          a reason for this great popularity? (And surly this makes it something
          I should focus on learning as a new developer).
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">
          But you haven’t chosen it yet so you know there must be an
          issue&hellip;?
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out jQuery might not be all it’s made out to be. The power of
          cross browser finicality has been diminished after the advent of IE-8:
          these days modern browsers tend to play nice [4][6].
        </p>
        <p>
          That oh so simple syntax staring that sexy magic ‘$’ once sliced away
          huge sections of vanilla JS – stripping complex functions down to a
          single line [3]. But these days vanilla functions often have similar
          lengths [4][6]. That super ‘$’ does reduce the number of lines one
          writes but its utility is both a blessing and a curse. It obfuscates
          long complex and inefficient functions – tricking fooling developers
          like me into thinking their code is more efficient because it is
          shorted and easier to type [5]. The insane number of functions. This
          syntax can become tricky to work with at times because it’s harder to
          control what exactly is being done [5][6] and leads to bad modern
          practice in some cases [4][5].
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">
          But it’s all work it for an efficiency boost right?
        </p>
        <p>Wrong! Vanilla JS Dom function perform better that jQuery[4].</p>
        <p>
          It might not even be work my while learning for the sake of its
          popularity because that too is on the decline [4].
        </p>
        <p>
          All that said, I doubt jQuery is going anywhere. It’s loaded with
          features and does seem very intuitive to work with. But from what I’ve
          seen I really comes into its own when performing http requests
          (something I don’t do a lot of). I have no problem with verbose or
          slightly long-winded code (or writing for that matter) for the sake of
          performance and robustness. As useful as jQuery is I think I’ll be
          giving it a miss.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, my research on jQuery put me of DOM libraries in general.
          They do some cool stuff, but nothing mind-blowing. I have had no
          problem access the DOM and if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. My main
          reason for perusing this avenue of library was the mirage of
          efficiency which has now been debunked.

      <section>
        <h2>How did I react?</h2>
        <p>
          My next though was a UI library. Something like
          <a class="inline-line" href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank"
            >React</a
          >
          sounds great for this.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views
          for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update
          and render just the right components when your data changes.
        </blockquote>
        <cite>react.org</cite>
        <p>
          React is component based and encourages modular and reusable code
          [7][8][9]. Its component logic is written in JS rather than html
          templates which makes it easier to handle states [7][8]. React makes
          UI easier to handle ad more efficient [7][8][9]. It’s growing
          super-fast with and constant flow of exciting updates [9] and has even
          surpassed jQuery in popularity [4][8].
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">You using it then?</p>
        <p>I'd Love to&hellip;</p>
        <p class="retoric">I sense a 'but' coming.</p>
        <p>Yip. Here it is:</p>
        <p>
          I do find it painful to work with scripts and html templates and
          reacts proposition is enticing. But I have my own system now. As much
          as I feel my site would gentility benefit from react, I would be
          fixing systems that already work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given my timeframe, I’m sure if this is the best way to ensure my site
          is packed with exciting features. Besides React is form UI only [8][9]
          so I would still need to find something else for loading content.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Time to aminate?</h2>
        <p>
          My next though was animation libraries. Those are great! My site has
          some animations, but it could do with a bit of spicing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this regard I am spoil for choice. Anime.JS looks awesome, it’s
          light weight and has tonnes of cool effects [10], although it can’t
          target pseudo elements which is a bit annoying [10].
        </p>
        <p>
          But not to fear, Green Sock can! It also boasts impressive performance
          and customisation with plugins [11]. It does everything from scroll
          events to tweening[11].
        </p>
        <p>
          Mo.js [12] is another exciting option promising simplicity,
          performance, and robustness.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are countless other examples. All of which boast similar (yest
          distinct) features. Adding animations to the site will make it feel
          more exiting. This will improve the user acceptance and enhance the
          impact of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The again I’ve already done relatively well with CSS. My site is quite
          simple. What exact do I need to animate that requires a library?
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Everything?</p>
        <p>
          If I animate everything then the animations lose their impact. But
          just looking at the sites for some of these animation libraries has me
          in awe. They boast jaw-dropping effects which could have a positive
          impact on the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, I can make an animation with CSS, but can I find it painful and
          finicky. These libraries will allow me to add more slick animations
          and trigger them from JavaScript with ease.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Good point.</p>
        <p>
          Yeah. CSS is fine. I could animate anything, but why should I? What’s
          wrong with toggling a CSS class? I do see how these libraries might
          make the process more convenient, but what would I be animating?
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Hmm&hellip; no clue.</p>
        <p>I felt the same. Then it hit me.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Page Transitions!</h2>
        <p>
          It’s one thing I don’t have, have no clue how to get and defiantly
          need ASAP.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Why?</p>
        <p>
          Because they are awesome and will make my site feel more connected,
          more coherent, and more refined. They will enhance the user experience
          and allow to display my work in new and exciting ways.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Errr&hellip; I don't get it.</p>
        <p>Don't worry, it will all be explaued next time.</p>
