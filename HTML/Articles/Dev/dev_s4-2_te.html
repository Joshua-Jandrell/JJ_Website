        If you didn’t already know, I’ve been making this site as an assignment
        for interactive media.

        is my final submission. Before I say my goodbyes here’s how I feel about
        this site and everything else.

            Because I could have done so much more. There were so many cool
            things I had planned. Fun new ideas I wanted to implement.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to start a code section, separate from the dev-log. It would
            be less about the code on this site ad more about stuff it programs
            in general. Articles would also be more like tutorials and less like
            reflections. This would be a way to show my skills as a programmer
            and enhance my portfolio. That’s partly why set up he code
            highlighter which is now criminally underused.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, I haven’t even finished all the write-ups for the dev-log
            (and I really want to talk about the hypertext widgets I have
            finally implemented). I also want to add a couple more portfolio
            games.
          </p>

            Lots. I wanted to got back and edit some of my long-winded and
            rumbly blogs with some hypertext formatting (like this article
            here). They are quick long and rumbly, defiantly in need of a
            rework. The hypertext setting allows me to go down rabbit holes and
            take the reader on tangents more naturally. It will be like a
            conversation. We are quite side-tracked here &dash; but you chose to
            get side-tracked with me.

              Well obviously, I want to do this hypertext thing for my about

          I know right! But that’s always the case with me. I bite off more than
          I can chew. I try to do much. I end up spending more time imagining
          everything than doing it.

          I’m frustrated because I feel like I let myself down. I feel as if
          silly things like dynamic CSS and adding basic mark-up and meta data
          should be quick and easy. Yet precious hours slip through my fingers.

          I look this whole site and I don’t see how it took me three weeks. I

          <p>No worries, I know it’s pretty weird and confusing.</p>
          <p>
            You see I hold myself to very hight standards. I don’t care about
            marks or praise. I just want to please myself. Unfortunately he’s a
            tough crowd. I always see ways to improve and push myself. I’ll
            never settle for ‘good enough’ because I know it can be better.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could probably have done the bare minimum well. Made a simple
            static site with not dev-log, no templates, and no hypertext. It
            would have looked the same. Swup would have been easier to
            integrate.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could have spent more time making my site looking extra pretty and
            less time glaring at monstrous bugs of my own creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, this is a massive weakness. I’m doing my own thing
            and failing to do what I should focus on. But in a way it’s also my
            biggest strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learnt and grown so much through these struggles. Even if it
            isn’t all reflected in my site, I know a lot of it is. If I took the
            easy path, I may be able to live better and sleep more. Possible
            even get a better mark thanks to fewer bugs and coherent editing.

          <p>But I don’t care.</p>

            more.

            Please don’t bother trying to find all the branches and possible
            narratives. These new widgets of mine are very much a work in
            progress. They don’t do revers traversal and retracing of steps with
            good grace. I know how to fix it, but now is not the time. (I’m also
            not sure if they all work so now that you're here it’s best you
            stay).
          </p>
          <p>
            The labyrinth of links up there probably seems very uncalled for,
            rather confusing, unrelated to the task at hand and a bit of a waste
            of time. (Depending on how you got here, sometimes it’s a breeze.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Those links summarise my site and my design experience perfectly.
          </p>
          <h3>Tedious and fiddly.</h3>
          <p>
            Even with my arsenal of custom HTML elements, setting up text like
            that is tricky. I’ve never written a branching narrative in my life
            before, let alone one in my own temperamental medium. It’s not easy
            to plot out and I ended up needing to cut down on quite a lot of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps I should have spent more time writing and less time making
            widgets like
            <code class="inline">&lt;toggle-block&gt;</code> which I didn’t even
            end up using because it's still a bit buggy. Actually,
            <em>Everything</em> is still a bit buggy!
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m trying to do something new and unusual. Perhaps I am innovating
            and pushing the envelope. Branching hypertext narratives are
            interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also doing something that nobody asked for and 99% of the
            population make do without. What’s wrong with just using twine. I
            did it all myself but is it worth it?
          </p>
          <p>
            On a macro scale my site is in the same predicament. It’s got some
            rather nifty features. You know: automating templet creation with
            custom HTML elements, it’s own API for importing HTML form other
            documents, which supports and automated index creation system. I
            even have my own update-on-scroll function and a code-preview
            element.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these tasks were intreating to tackle and thrilling to solve.
            But none of them make it a better site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, hypertext is exciting. But there is a reason that linear
            narratives still exist: they tell the best stories. I could probably
            have my point above with fewer words, less buttons and in a shorter
            amount of time. And it would be clear and concise!
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t get me wrong I’m proud of what I’ve done with this site. I
            pushed myself to the limits of my skills and understanding and one
            can only ever learn and grow from something like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The auto indexing system is less tedious than a static equivalent
            and I can’t deny the utility of templets as design patterns. I know
            they're helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I just don’t see direct effects on my site. Infract I was so focused
            on these system that I dropped the ball with the basics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a poorly edited bracing narrative when a well written
            paragraph would do?
          </p>
          <h3>But it’s looking quite nice</h3>
          <p>
            That it is. It’s a big clucky here and there but the aesthetic
            works. It’s minimal and professional yet still interesting. The
            monospace and pseudo elements add visual intrigue while evoking
            ideas of programming and design. The contrast between orange an blue
            gives the site a sense of energy and makes thing pop, although I
            does feel and bit light at time. Sometimes I feel my articles could
            do with more colour. The orange and blue sections on the game pages
            really make thing pop and bring the site to life. It’s a bit harder
            to incorporate colourful blocks into text like this.
          </p>
          <h3>And the navigation is getting there</h3>
          <p>
            I think my navigation is the best it’s been so far! There is greater
            unity and consistency between sections and pages which provides a
            sense of unity and makes it easier for visitors to learn to use my
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s easier than ever before to move between articles, especially
            with the new side navigation in the games (portfolio) section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swup is a nice touch and privies some fluency however some
            transitions can still be a bit awkward. I’m not unhappy with my
            choice of library although I feel I should have taken a leap of
            faith in something more substantial. Perhaps react could have got my
            hypertext widgets up and running&hellip;
          </p>
          <h3>It could be more&hellip;</h3>
          <p>I am still disappointed.</p>
          <p>
            This site could be so much more. There is an mountian to edit and
            fix. And an irresistible array of new ideas to try.
          </p>
          <p>
            Five months ago I could not write JS, CSS or even HTML. Now I’m
            building a system to show off my code (I don't think it's fantastic,
            but I’m still proud of it).
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started I sore I would be glad to be rid of web pages. But
            not the time has come I don’t want to let do. I’ve got a taste of
            this exciting new world and now I’m hooked.

            With so much more to explore and so many options for expanding my
            website what I have right now (be it branching narrative or flowing
            essay) feels incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>How can I submit with so many tangents unchased?</p>
          <p>
            How could I call it quits with mountains of stones left unturned?
          </p>
          <p>Why should I?</p>
          <p>
            I said that I was making this website as an assignment. Well, that’s
            about to change (although I unfortunately I was kinda doing my own
            thing already to some degree).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I’m free to do what I want with this site. Why not take it to
            the next level?
