      From unequal access <cite>[1]</cite> to racist algorithms
      <cite>[2]</cite>, it's hard to deny that the internet is riddled with
      danger, unfairness and inequality. But why? Is the internet an
      abomination: poorly conceived and irresponsibly designed? Or does it
      merely reflect the injustices of society at large? Is the internet a
      monster &dash; hard-coded with implicit bias &dash; or a mirror &dash;
      reflecting the injustice of society at large? Understanding what's wrong
      with the internet is great and all &dash; but it's also high time we
      discussed how we can fix it.

        <h2 class="main-h">What? The internet is Amazing!</h2>
        <p>
          The power and utility of the internet cannot be denied! The internet
          has the potential to connect people across the world and facilitate a
          the sharing of diverse experiences and ideas <cite>[3, 4]</cite>. This
          powerful tool can transcend space and time &dash; allowing for global
          communication, knowledge sharing and commerce
          <!--Think about Y commercs?-->
          <cite>[3]</cite>. The world wide web makes information accessible to
          all, improving access to knowledge and education <cite>[4]</cite>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-h">
          &hellip; In theory &dash; yes &dash; but in practice?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not really. Yes, the internet has the potential to be all of the above
          but is doomed to fail. Internet access is not evenly distributed
          <cite>[1 ,4, 5]</cite> and as a result the internet is hardly a beacon
          of all-encompassing human knowledge. Only about 59% of the world
          population has internet access <cite>[4]</cite> &dash; but more
          disturbingly most of those who access, engage with and contribute to
          the internet are from the global north <cite>[1]</cite>. If the
          internet is to fulfil is promise of global utility and diversity
          allowing equal access must be a priority of digital justice
          <cite>[3,4]</cite>. Those without the internet will remain left
          behind, and forgotten <cite>[1, 3, 4]</cite> making digital
          representation a humanitarian issue and a basic human right
          <cite>[4]</cite>. If work is not done to provide internet access to
          all, existing societal inequalities will be reflected and exacerbated
          in the digital space.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="main-h">We made a monster?</h2>
        <p>
          But digital justice isn't really that simple. Aside from the
          logistical concerns of providing internet to all; the internet in its
          current form might not be as helpful as we think. We often see the
          internet (and technology as a whole) as providing solutions
          <cite>[5, 6]</cite>
          and answering problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Tech == good' people are better with tech and the problem is that
          more people need tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          This utility argument portrays technology as a neutral tool &dash; a
          benevolent medium which acts as an unbiased mirror &dash; reflecting
          the injustices of society at large. As a result we often overlook its
          shortcomings as a lack of representation or unjust data
          <cite>[6]</cite>. How could this all be the fault of the internet?
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet isn't just here and now: it's a structure of data and a
          repository of information <cite>[7]</cite>. It's not just this web
          page &dash; it's the data behind this web page, the code that made
          this web page. It's the algorithm that gave you this web page and the
          data you give it by visiting this web page. It the analytics used to
          profile you based on visiting this web page. It's all the pages you
          have ever visited before &dash; all the pages that have ever existed
          before.
          <!--FIX!!!!!!!!!!-->All the data that's associated with all that and
          all the data that existed before web pages were even a thing. It's
          big. It's scary. It's deep. It's dark and it's far more than chat
          rooms and cat memes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Contributions to the internet
          <!--POP-->(algorithms and cat memes alike) disproportionately
          represent certain demographics and thus marginalize others
          <cite>[1, 5]</cite>. Like any system with feedback &dash; the state of
          the internet is a function of time.
          <!--Look at wroding here-->The positive feedback loop of northern
          dominance cannot be be undone with flash-in-the-pan diversity. (The
          classic example of this is a bath tub, filled with boiling water
          &dash; one cannot suddenly open the cold tap an hop in expecting not
          to get burnt.) When previously underrepresented people/cultures/ideas
          are suddenly exposed to a dominant digital culture, they risk being
          overwritten and lost <cite>[1, 4]</cite> rather than embraced.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="main-h">But why does it matter?</h2>
        <p>
          Okay sure. The internet was made by Americans
          <cite>[1]</cite> &dash; but we all use it now. Avoiding all technology
          is ludacris. Besides, this tub is far too full for us to pull the
          plug. Perhaps we should just accept that cultures change. Society
          changes. Progress is inevitable. If you think that's bad you should
          hurl your device across the room, stop bathing and run around with a
          club. So there you have it folk. Digital justice is pointless. Who
          cares if some ideas are lost? We weren't using them anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, progress is inevitable but, marginalization does not have to be.
          If technology were apolitical and unbiased then there would be no
          problem &dash; but this line of thought <em>is</em> the problem.
          Algorithms are seen to be mirrors &dash; reflecting societal data. But
          that mirror is convex! Its reflection is distorted &dash; we see
          monsters as a result. Algorithms don't just reflect societal injustice
          in a dataset &dash; they perpetuate it <cite>[6]</cite>. They may be
          intended as unbiased and objective
          <cite>[2, 6]</cite>
          yet they cannot transcend the limited perspectives of their creators
          <cite>[5, 6]</cite>. It is all to easy to blame the data instead of
          question the implicit biased within out own solution <cite>[6]</cite>.
          Perhaps it's hard to see. Like drops of water going into a bath tub.
          But suddenly you get an algorithm which appears to have been coded to
          crops the elderly, Africans and Muslims out of photographs
          <cite>[2]</cite>. That's one of may, may examples <cite>[6]</cite>.
          It's all very well to identify and address these issues as they
          emerge. Calls to review problematic algorithms <cite>[2]</cite> and
          engage with civil society <cite>[5, 6]</cite> are important steps. But
          I refuse to believe that people with technical skills are unable to
          address these issues during development. Even if problems cant' fully
          be solved and trade-offs have to be made, I get it, there are no right
          answers. But at least think about it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-h">
          You don't need the internet; the internet needs you
        </h2>
        <p>
          Look, accidents happen. I have to concede that if I were to consider
          all of the thinks that could go and try my best to make an unbiased
          system I would fail. Something would go horribly wrong there would be
          unforeseen consequences. (well duh, that's what makes them
          unforeseen). As such, just, impartial software is impossible. And yet
          is is still an idea I believe we should strive towards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its all well and good to say that all humans need the internet's
          information <cite>[3, 4]</cite>, but really the internet needs the
          perspectives of a diver society. Each new perspective gives new
          insights into the types of issues that could occur and the types of
          problems that need to considered. Each voice (or silent user's data
          trail) on the internet provides more data. All of these parts can only
          ever work together to make a greater whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          So you, whoever you are, whatever you think. Don't ever be fooled into
          thinking that the interment is a benevolent provider. Nature or
          nurture, monster or mirror, the internet is only ever as good as it's
          users, its creators and the data it contains. It is our duty to be
          mindful of what that is and how we contribute to is &dash; so that one
          day the utilitarian internet of equal access and divers participation
          may become a tangible idea rather than a misguided fallacy. To put
          more than just hot water in that bath tub so that in time more people
          feel comfortable to hop in.
