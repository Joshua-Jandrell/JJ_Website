        Hi there. I remember why I don’t write about everything in the dev-log.
        It’s great and all, I hope you enjoy it. But It’s super tedious. I need
        to make a site and I’ve set myself insanely strict deadlines. Formatting
        these articles is not quick and easy task. I’ll be developing for a
        while and only comment if I have something Important to say. Otherwise,
        I spend more time talking about what I did than actually doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like I said: I’m not going to be writing for a bit. No more content for
        you! (Sorry)
      </p>
