      I need to add an external JavaScript Dependency/Framework/Library to my
      website. But, before I do all that I need to decide what sort of
      library/framework/dependency do I want? What functions do I need? What
      will be most useful? It’s time to find out.

        <h2>Framework vs library</h2>
        <p class="retoric">Potaato, potatto?</p>
        <img
          load-src="/Assets/Images/Other/well-yes-but-min.jpg"

        <p>
          Libraries are, as their names suggests, a collection of functions
          <cite><a href="#dev_3-07_ref" class="inline-link">[1, 2]</a></cite>
          You can pick one up off the shelf, read it, and pop it back when
          you're done. In essence a library is a collection of code snippets
          with an API of fintions you can use for get a great deal of
          functionality. Call it from your code and let it do its thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a library is a collection of books, then the framework is the
          building in which they were housed. (Okay the metaphor is a stretch –
          but I’ve started with it). You don’t call frameworks – frameworks call
          you. Structure for your code/website/app/death-ray in accordance with
          a framework and it will grant you great powers. But, if your code and
          file structure doesn’t follow it’s rules it won’t understand what you
          want and will be unable to assist.

        <h2>So, what do I want?</h2>
        <p>I have a bt of a challeng &dash;</p>
        I don't really know.
        <p>
          I’ve already developed quite a bit of JS. Granted it’s not the best,
          most versatile, most functional, or most efficient. But it’s mine and
          it does what I want it to do. I get it and it gets me. Do I really
          want to replace that with a new dependency of the sake of a new
          dependency?
        </p>
        <p>That’s silly!</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Can I make a frame[work] work?</h2>
        <p>
          When I comes to frameworks, I have my own charming vanilla homunculus.
          Look, it’s sure as heck not the Vitruvian man of
          <cite
            ><a
              href="https://angularjs.org/"
              class="inline-link"
              target="_blank"
              >AngularJS</a
            ></cite
          >
          &dash; but it can load files, make templates, and populate my webpage.
          I’m not making a web-app, I don’t have a backend. Why on earth would I
          want to get a butler to manage this ramshackle shack of a site?
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides I think that a framework is great if you are starting 'from
          scratch'. That way you can built a system to truly capitalise on the
          framework’s functionality. Less work for you from day one!.
        </p>
        <p>
          That ship has already sailed. I’ve done the leg work. I don’t see the
          point of smashing this site into a framework for the sake of an
          external dependency, I’ll use a fraction of the framework’s
          functionality and have unnecessary setup work.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The other option is lib-very [library] appealing</h2>
        <p>
          Now let’s look at the libraries. Most of which pride themselves as
          being easy to integrate into an existing system
          <cite><a href="#dev_3-07_ref" class="inline-link">[1]</a></cite
          >and very efficient
          <cite><a href="#dev_3-07_ref" class="inline-link">[1, 2]</a></cite
          >. Now that’s what I like to here!
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, I am faced with the same conundrum as before. Every problem
          I have faced so far has been addresses with my own home-brewed vanilla
          moonshine. It’s defiantly not triple distilled
          <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"
            >jQuery</a
          >
          or single malt<a
            href="https://reactjs.org/"
            target="_blank"
            class="inline-link"
            >React</a
          >. If you drink it you’ll probably go blind.
        </p>
        <p>
          But! It has all the functions <em>I</em> want. I know how it works
          (and what’s wrong with it). This booby trap of a site has everything
          from
          <a href="/devlog.html#dev_2-02" class="inline-link"
            >asynchronous html injections</a
          >
          to the
          <a href="/devlog.html#dev_2-03" class="inline-link">shodow DOM</a>.
          Normie libraries might have their place in the high echelons of
          civilised web development. But in my journy as a desinger web-dev is a
          new frounteer. This site it the wild-wild west and you need a stronger
          drink.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">
          Oh, so you think you better than the libraries huh?
        </p>
        <p>
          Heck no. I just don’t want to remake what I have already done for the
          sake of it.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">
          Weren’t you in the process of remaining your <em>ENTIRE WEBSITE</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, if I’m going to pick a library its going to need to have some
          juicy functionality that genially improves my website. I’m not
          throwing one in for the sake of it.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">
          You sacred you going to break something aren’t you?
        </p>
        <p>Terrified.</p>
        <p>
          The navigational also isn’t great. My system is a pain to set up and
          full of bugs. Most of the links work most of the time: but it takes
          just one bad egg (and I have dozens).
        </p>
        <p>
          My CSS is okay. But it’s in need of a revamp. The stylesheets are
          wayyyy to big and full of lots of repeated code. The structure and
          animation are achieved with very hacky means and are generally quite
          fragile.
        </p>
        <p>I change one tiny thing and it all goes crazy.</p>
        <p class="retoric">
          And you are getting comfy with JavaScript &dash; you want to play it
          safe.
        </p>
        <p>Kinda.</p>
        <p>
          I just want to be incontrol. I know my system. I don't know someone
          eles's.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">
          You're worried that you won't be as compitent becuase you'll need to
          learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know my site needs help. It could be cleaner, as I’ve said it
          before. The JS in could be better, faster, and stronger. My DOM
          traversal and manipulation are messy. I was leaning on the job when I
          wrote most of the code. I know how to improve it&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>So I should do that.</p>
        <p class="retoric">But a liabray can improve it for you.</p>
        <p>&hellip;but I learn by improving&hellip;</p>
        <p class="retoric">
          And you’ll learn new while implementing a library.
        </p>
        <p>&hellip;but&hellip;</p>
        <p>&hellip;you see&hellip;</p>
        <p class="retoric">
          why should you do something that someone else already did?
        </p>
        <p>&hellip;umm&hellip;</p>
        <p class="retoric">
          Using libraires is part of being a good programer.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe&hellip;</p>
        <p>&hellip;hmmm&hellip;</p>
        <p>&hellip;I guess you have a point.</p>
        <p>
          I don’t want to sell my soul to a framework: but perhaps I could
          strike a deal with a different devil.
        </p>
        <p>Net time I'll figure out what that deal is.</p>
