        What, when and why will I be doing. For the first time so far, I have
        decided to plan ahead. I must submit in two weeks, and I should be ready
        to ensure that I don’t have to rush to get that done.

          I have not clue. The brief isn’t out yet. But I presume that it’ll be
          an improvement of my current site. Given my insistence on another
          reboot and the need to juggle other projects too, I can’t really
          afford to site and wait for the next brief before devising a scheme
          and breaking ground.

          I plan to have v0.3 (this iteration) ready, with all the
          functionalities of the previous site, by midnight on Wednesday (15
          June). That will give me a week and a half to add new features. I also
          want to setup a better method for code display by then because I am
          doing a lot of that now and the current system is award to use and
          ugly to view.

        <h2>This sounds over ambitious&hellip;</h2>
        <p>
          I am always over ambitious. Doing the work of two moths in two days
          sounds crazy – but the through has already been done. I have no need
          to faf or be distracted by design. I just need to implement and
          rework. My hope is that a strict schedule will force me to focus on
          the task at hand.
        </p>
        <h3>Task breakdown</h3>

        Monday (Today)
        <ul>
          <li>Create and organised filing system.</li>
          <li>Build a code preview system with JS</li>
          <li>
            Simple and generic CSS style sheet that should be reusable in all

        </ul>
        <p>
          The order in which I’m doing all this may seem weird: but I promise it
          will make more sense as I work through everything and expand on each
          task.
