        It’s that time again. I have burnt my old site down. It is now time for
        this site rise out of the ashes better, stronger, and more refined than
        ever before. But how will I do this? What does it even mean? Why is it
        necessary?

        <h2>A new vision</h2>
        <p>
          The previous site wasn’t bad – but it has some major flaws. Most of
          which were behind the scenes, with bad repo organisation, over
          complicated CSS and disorganised JavaScript. Although most of these
          problems appeared to be behind the scenes, they often fund weird ways
          of casing their shadow on the presentation if the site and limiting
          what I could actually do.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the last iteration, I had set up a semiautomated contend
          population system and automatic custom html template creation. Both
          systems had potential as powerful development tools: however, my
          system was not designed to capitalise on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s time a build and new HTML structure that favours such systems and
          allows for simple and repeatable setup.

        <h2>But why?</h2>
        <p>
          As a young engineer-to-be I have learnt that good designers,
          engineers, and problem solvers are often lazy. This ‘laziness’ allows
          one to do more with less time, effort, and resources. If I make a site
          that is easy to develop and maintain then I will have more time to
          polish and produce quality content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s look at my current blog section. To add a new blog post I need
          to format its contents as semantic HTML is one file. Then I still need
          to create a separate file to act as a container for said contents, and
          finally I need to add links to both to a JavaScript list so that I can
          create index sections. There are more combination and complexities to
          it but that basic trade-off was for perceived efficiency of product
          over efficiency of design. Both concepts are equally important, but my
          solution sat of the fence and thus solved neither.
        </p>

        <h2>How will the new one be better?</h2>
        <p>
          I will be made for automation from square one. One of the biggest
          issues with my old site was that I made automation and repetition o
          structure inherently hard because they were originally finnicky and
          fragile. For example, my CSS classes often changes dramatically based
          on the context they were used in or the other classes they were
          combined with. At the time of writing the CSS it made sense to me –
          but I was way too complicated ot keep track of. As a result, I ended
          up repeating CSS so that I could get the same effect as elsewhere
          without worrying about permutations. Developing was doing the same
          setup and grunt work over and over again each time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to make the new site cleaner, better organised and easier to
          expand and maintain. This goes for CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and general
          repo organisation. It’s not just about planning to be minimalistic and
          clean – that’s always one’s intention. It’s about documenting what do
          so that I’m not confused by it later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve always wanted to do that, but documentation felt tedious. And it
          will be. But I know it’s also going to be worth it later. If I add to
          this dev-log more regularly I will not become the herculean chore it
          has grown into in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          And speaking of the past… It’s not just organisation of assets I
          should consider but organisation of time. One of my biggest failures
          has been failing to implement everything I wanted to because of
          deadlines. I fool myself into thinking I am progressing because I am
          working on the site. But, without clear deadlines or goals, work often
          flounders around in circles, leaving me with little to show for my
          efforts. Sure, I learn – but I’m not just learning, I’m making
          something here. And I need to make it as well as it can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I start designing, I need to design what and when I will
          design, and that’s coming up next.
